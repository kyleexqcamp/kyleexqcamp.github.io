    <p><h2>What is Communication?</h2>
    <p>In its simplest form, communication occurs when a message  is sent by a sender and received by a receiver. Communication is a concept far more complex than a simple verbal or written exchange.</p>
    <p>There are many forms of communication besides what we say, including how we speak, our body language, and personal space. Complications often occur when the message sent does not equal the message received. By recognising and understanding your leadership style, these complications can be reduced, allowing you to communicate more effectively in your day to day life. </p>

    <p>Communication is one manifestation of personality style. Communication style is important because it affects our everyday interactions. What’s My Communication Style? is an assessment that identifies personal communication style. </p>
